In a computer systems programming class with C, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how software interacts with hardware at a low level. I want to learn key concepts like memory management, pointers, and data structures, as well as how operating systems handle processes, files, and system calls. This class will help me write efficient, reliable code while improving my ability to debug and solve complex problems. SEtting up the git repository and docker were seamless as I have done it before but learning about such a useful extension on VS code has been very helpful.
